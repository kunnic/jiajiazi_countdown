# JiaJiaZi's Countdown Timer ‚è≥
## Shoutout to JiaJiaZi my beloved idol.

## What is this?
In our fandom, we have something called "‰∏âÂπ¥‰πãÁ∫¶" (The Three-Year Pact). It's a promise we make to stay connected for at least three years. While it might sound like a curse, to us it represents a promise for the future‚Äîto remain together for far longer than just three years. This project is a simple countdown timer for the Three-Year Pact.

## Techincal
Technically, the destination time is October 18th, 2026. I used the getTime() function to obtain the time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch for both the destination time and the current time. By subtracting these two values, I can calculate the remaining time and update it every second.

## Features
- **Accurate Countdown**: Counts down to the millisecond (well, almost).
- **Language Support**: Choose from English, ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá, and Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát. Because why not, every one loves their own language and they'll have better understanding (yes).
- **Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è**: Literally. Check the footer!

## Why Did We Make This?
I'm bored, why not? üòÑ
